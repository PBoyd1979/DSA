                <h3>UML - Unified Modelling Language</h3>
                <p>
                  Based on a collaboration of Grady, Booch &amp; Rumbaugh (The Three Amigos) and interest from the big three at the time Microsoft, Oracle and IBM in the mid 90’s. A book was published called ‘The Unified Modelling Language User Guide’ in 1999 providing the industry standard we use today. <br />  
                  The basis of UML came from a number of other notions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Object Orientated Design</li>
                  <li>Object Modeling Technique</li>
                  <li>Object Orientated Software Engineering</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The purpose of UML was to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Provide software developers a similar process and language to communicate ideas</li>
                  <li>Offering visual tools and user focused techniques</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Digital Skills Academy has produced a simple Infographic that shows the UML process which was used in the development of Medic!

                  <li>Does the user have a clear goal?</li>
                  <li>Have you set a scene where the user achieves that goal?</li>
                  <li>Have you avoided a specific reference to a interaction that is designed?</li>
                  <li>Are you scenarios too similar or inadequate?</li>

                <h4>Now</h4>
                <p>When I'm travelling different place every second day just enough time for me to get my bearings, explore and move on. Cost is managed closely and I work on a strict budget, ensuring I get to see much as possible while I travel. So getting sick or even not being 100% can lead to huge complications and these environments. Asking the local hostel set the past have been a problem with medical centres and hacks giving kickbacks of them for referrals, cost can also be an issue. Some of these places also can be in areas that are not that safe and difficult to get to.</p>

                <p>When I'm travelling to a different place every second day just enough time for me to get my bearings, explore and move on. Cost is managed closely and I work on a strict budget, ensuring I get to see much as possible while I travel. It can be difficult at times especially when I cannot speak the local language. So getting sick or even not being 100% can lead to huge complications and these environments. To have a reliable diagnosis by going onto my phone and interacting with medic! was brilliant! With all my vital information already known to medic the process of it letting know my symptoms was simple and easy to do. Despite limited data coverage in the area Medic! still was able to provide a quick reliable diagnosis with possible options for treatment. One of the options was to guide me a nearby medical facility to consult a professional who was reputable and trustworthy. This information and service insured that I had peace of mind and knowledge why that was back home you I was being cared for.</p>

                <h4>2 - The Foreign Student (Little fish in a big pond)</h4>
                <h4>Now</h4>
                <p>Being away from my parents and family for the first time in a foreign place is quite daunting. Finding my feet is a challenge and making new friends and socialising as well as getting on top of the school work can be quite stressful. I'm also getting to enjoy the social side more and starting to feel a little run down, possibly a cold of flu. With nominal funds left this month, I would have to spend my last pennies or ask my parents for funds which I really don't want to do.</p>

                <p>Being away from my parents and family for the first time in a foreign place is quite daunting. Finding my feet is a challenge and making new friends and socialising as well as getting on top of the school work can be quite stressful. I'm also getting to enjoy the social side more and starting to feel a little run down, possibly with a cold of flu. With nominal funds left this month, and not wanting to ask my parents for more money, I’m hesitant to spend it on going to see a doctor. Use my phone to get a diagnosis from a reliable source made things easy. Medic! Already knew so much about me and was able to take the additional information I provided to make a quick and simple diagnosis. Medic! Was able to show me where the nearest pharmacy was and Dr as well as contact details, allowing me with the information to make an informed decision.</p>
